# Scripts used for drawing figures in the paper
## Main figures
### Figure 3
1. Data generation: `etch_yield/get_data/batch_run.py`, using the binary
   compiled from `etch_yield/get_data/fast_cpp/main.cpp` (use `compile.sh`
   within the folder). Also refer to `etch_yield/get_data/path.yaml`.
   (Or one may use `etch_yield/plot_profile.py` for generation with python.)
3. Plot `etch_yield/plot_with_experiments/plot.py`. Etch yield data should be
   written in `etch_yield/plot_with_experiments/dat.yaml`.

### Figure S5
1. Data generation: refer to Figure 3.
2. Plot `etch_yield/plot_overview/plot_overview.py`. Paths of etch yield should
   be written in `etch_yield/plot_overview/path.yaml`.

### Figure S6
1. Data generation: refer to Figure 3.
2. Plot `etch_yield/plot_profile_single.py`. `etch_yield/CF_300.dat` was used.
